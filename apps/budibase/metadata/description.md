# Budibase

Budibase is an open source platform for building internal tools, dashboards, and automated workflows in minutes. It lets you visually design responsive interfaces with drag-and-drop components, wire them to SQL, REST, or CSV data sources, and publish production-ready experiences without maintaining separate frontend and backend stacks.

This Runtipi-ready image starts the Budibase web builder so you can quickly launch, iterate, and deploy internal apps alongside the rest of your self-hosted services.
