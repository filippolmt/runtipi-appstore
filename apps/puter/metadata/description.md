# Puter

Puter is a browser-based cloud desktop that lets you self-host a personal workspace with files, applications, and collaboration features. Deploying it on Runtipi gives you a private alternative to managed cloud desktops while keeping data under your control.

## Features
- Desktop-like interface accessible from any modern browser
- Built-in file manager, notes, terminal, and extensible apps
- Multi-user support with permission controls
- Persistent storage for configuration and user data

## Getting Started
1. Configure the optional timezone and UID/GID values to match your host setup.
2. Launch the service and access Puter via the exposed port (default 4100).
3. Complete the onboard setup inside the web interface to create users and customize your workspace.
