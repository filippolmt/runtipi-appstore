## Usage

In order to generate a feed, a valid URL with parameters has to be appended to the main domain for your RSSHub instance, varying with each different app. More on the how-to's for each supported service or app can be found on [https://docs.rsshub.app/guide/](https://docs.rsshub.app/guide/), and on [https://docs.rsshub.app/guide/parameters](https://docs.rsshub.app/guide/parameters) for filtering/sorting/limiting your feed in a given URL.

## Access Control

RSSHub provides an access control feature for restricting which user generates a feed within your instance. This can be enabled with the `ACCESS_KEY` field during installation. Default value is empty, which means no extra key is required in order to access a feed through the URLs.
